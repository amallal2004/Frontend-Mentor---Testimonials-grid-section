        <h1 class="container__card__title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.</h1>
        <p class="container__card__para">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="container__card__para">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

        <h1 class="container__card__title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
        <p class="container__card__para">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
          were great and very helpful. I highly recommend the bootcamp to anyone interested in making their 
          living as a web developer. ”</p>
